#!/usr/bin/env bash
# CLAUDE.md invariant 25: this repository is public, and it carries no quote of
# the owner, no `@<owner>` provenance marker and no "<owner> said / asked /
# decided" attribution.
#
# WHY
#
# A decision still has to be recorded, because a later reader must know it is
# not to be re-derived. The public form is `@decided YYYY-MM-DD` followed by a
# paraphrase, never edited afterwards. The verbatim words, and the marker that
# names the person, live in private places only. Until 2026-10-08 nothing held
# that here. This tree was already clean when the gate arrived; the sibling
# stack-k8s was not (four markers, two quotes, four attributions by name), and
# the same file is the gate there.
#
# WHAT THIS CHECKS
#
# Every text file `git ls-files` lists (a file with a NUL byte is binary and
# skipped), every line:
#
#   - the owner's provenance marker, `@` and the first name, any case;
#   - any Cyrillic letter: the owner writes in Ukrainian, this repository is in
#     English, and Cyrillic in these repositories has only ever been a quote, a
#     file name from a private note, or a probe's output that belongs
#     translated;
#   - a guillemet, the quotation mark those quotes are written in;
#   - the owner's first name or surname as a word, unless the line is a
#     copyright, author or maintainer line. A name as the copyright holder is
#     ownership, not a quote; anywhere else in a public file it has only ever
#     been an attribution ("<name>'s call", "in <name>'s words").
#
# The name is built from pieces below so this file does not trip itself, and
# the harness plants its faults the same way.
#
# AND IT REFUSES TO REPORT OK ON NOTHING: no tracked text file at all is a
# failure that says it measured nothing.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It cannot see a quote in English with no name beside it
# ("he said 'do it all'"), a paraphrase that is really a quote, or anything in
# git history: a rewrite here leaves the old text in earlier commits.
set -uo pipefail
# The repository this file lives in (it sits in scripts/), whatever directory it
